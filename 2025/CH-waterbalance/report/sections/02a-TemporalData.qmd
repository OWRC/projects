### DataCurrent {#sec-ch-datacurrent}

Access to Conservation Halton's [DataCurrent web portal](https://smartcitywater.ca/datacurrent/) was granted. From there, a variety of time-series data was collected within and adjacent to CH's boundary, including:

1. Precipitation and air temperature data from 42 stations 
2. Climate data from 3 weather stations
3. Snow depth and snow water equivalent data from 6 snow stations
4. Water level, estimated discharge and storage volume, air temperature, water temperature and miscellaneous climate data (where available) from 4 CH reservoirs
5. Water level, water temperature and preliminary discharge data (where available) from 13 stream gauging stations within CH jurisdiction (Not including Water Survey of Canada gauges)

> These data are collected by 4 agencies: Halton Region, City of Hamilton, City of Oakville and Conservation Halton. 


#### Precipitation

Precipitation stations show good coverage over the study area, having sub-daily data recorded from 1996. Many stations also keep record of air temperature, while some also record air pressure.

#### Snow depth

Snow course data have been collected at 6 locations since 1973 and provide snow depth and snow water equivalents (SWE) measurements roughly every 2 weeks.

Daily snow depths are also recorded at the CH Administration Office beginning in 2019; however, as with snow courses, no snowfall data are reported.


#### Reservoir Stages

Stage data from four Reservoirs operated by CH is included in DataCurrent from the years 2016--2023:

<!-- 1. Scotch Block
1. Hilton Falls
1. Kelso Dam
1. Mountsberg -->

### Environment Canada

#### Climate data

There is only one Environment Canada and Climate Change (ECCC) climate station located within the study area: [Georgetown WWTP (6152695)](https://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_data/daily_data_e.html?StationID=4923){target="_blank"}. Unlike the DataCurrent stations, this station discriminates between rainfall and snowfall as opposed to solely reporting precipitation data. Location is shown in @fig-map-sws.

Georgetown WWTP is an active station [recording data](https://owrc.shinyapps.io/sHyMet/?sID=148831){target="_blank"} since August, 1962. The station measures rainfall, snowfall, temperature (min/max/mean) and the depth of snowpack and reports on a daily basis. Having rainfall and snowfall reported independently allows for the analysis of temperature ranges that dictate the phase of precipitation (@fig-Tcrit-distrib). Having snowfall and depth of snowpack allows for the analysis of snowmelt dynamics.

```


#### Streamflow gauges

Eight Water Survey of Canada (WSC) gauges maintain long-term daily mean streamflow data. All stations have great periods of record (>20 years) and all but 1 are up to date and are shown in @fig-map-sws. (Note: Oakville Creek is the same as Sixteen Mile Creek.)

The combined contributing area of these eight streamflow gauges covers roughly 630 km², or 2/3 of the study area. This is excellent coverage and would provide for good model calibration.

### Ontario Climate Data Portal {#sec-temporal-ocdp}

The [Ontario Climate Data Portal](https://lamps.math.yorku.ca/OntarioClimate/index_v18.htm){target="_blank"} (OCDP) is a provincially-funded future projection climate dataset covering Ontario on a grid with 10x14 km² cells. The data were compiled from the [Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5](https://climate-scenarios.canada.ca/?page=cmip5-intro){target="_blank"} (CMIP5). Daily ensemble climate projections from 32 Global Circulation Models (GCMs -- @tbl-ocdp-models) were downscaled by the Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium ([PCIC](https://www.uvic.ca/pcic/data-analysis-tools/data-portal/statistically-downscaled-scenarios/index.php)) and hosted by the LAboratory of Mathematical Parallel Systems (LAMPS) of Department of Mathematics and Statistics, York University. The data are free to download and are delivered in a form amenable to hydrologic modelling (i.e., daily precipitation and min/max air temperatures).  Future data can be collected up to the year 2100 in a number of [Representative Concentration Pathway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_Concentration_Pathway){target="_blank"} (RCP) scenarios.

Following the Province's guide for Assessing hydrologic impacts due to climate change (EBNFLO Environmental and AquaResource Inc., 2010), a set of 29 GCMs (3 models did not report temperatures) are plotted according to their projected change in precipitation and temperature among 2 time periods: one typically being a baseline/current condition vs. some future condition. The guide then suggests to pick out the models amongst this scatter: 

1. The scatter plot method -- where the 4 most-extreme models that "bound the uncertainty" of the set of available models; and
1. The percentile method -- where up to 10 models are selected that represent the 10^th^, 25^th^, 50^th^, 75^th^, and 90^th^ percentile of both change in precipitation and temperature.

These methods are presented in @fig-ocdp-model-scatter. The idea, then, is to take the set of models from either method and input them into a hydrologic model. The set of hydrologic model outputs represents the uncertainty of the GCM collection as a whole. Added to this plot, is the model that has the most central tendency (i.e., the median simulation)---this is the single future projection used later in this study.
