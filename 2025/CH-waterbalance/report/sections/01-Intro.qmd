# Introduction

Over the past year, significant progress has been made by [Conservation Halton](https://www.conservationhalton.ca/) on their Watershed Strategy and its supporting documents, all of which are accessible through the [Watershed Strategy website](https://www.conservationhalton.ca/watershed-strategy/). These foundational documents include the Watershed Characterization Report, Key Natural Resource Issues, Watershed Monitoring Programs Summary, Climate Change Vulnerability and Risk Assessment, and the Watershed Climate Resiliency Plan. Together, they provide a robust basis for advancing watershed planning efforts within CH's jurisdiction. The long-term vision is for all individual watersheds in the region to have completed watershed plans within the next five to ten years, beginning with the Sixteen Mile and Grindstone Creek watersheds.

While the current Watershed Strategy provides a high-level framework applicable across CH's jurisdiction, the next critical step involves refining this understanding at the individual watershed level. This process entails identifying and analyzing key human activities that influence the water cycle and natural processes, particularly in the context of urban growth and development. Additionally, a more detailed examination of climate change impacts is necessary to understand how they exacerbate existing environmental pressures and challenges.

A key data gap in the current body of work is the absence of a comprehensive water balance or water budget for the every watershed within CH's jurisdiction. While the existing Source Protection Tier 3 water budgets focus on drinking water systems, and the older Tier 2 budgets may hold some relevance, there is a pressing need to develop a watershed-scale water budget model. This will leverage CH's extensive monitoring data, much of which is already integrated into the [Oak Ridges Moraine Groundwater Program](https://www.oakridgeswater.ca/) (ORMGP) platform, to provide a spatially detailed understanding of water gains and losses within the watershed.

The primary objective is to establish a clear and comprehensive understanding of the water flow system and water resources in Sixteen Mile and Grindstone Creeks. This includes identifying key hydrological processes, assessing the influence of climate change, and recognizing areas of vulnerability. Recent climatic events have highlighted the dual threats of extreme drought and excessive water levels. For instance, during the 2022 drought, numerous private wells in Halton Hills ran dry, underscoring the need for localized assessments of vulnerable aquifers and their susceptibility to climate change. Conversely, recent spring flooding events emphasize the importance of a balanced approach that accounts for both water scarcity and water surplus.

Looking ahead, predictive modelling will be a crucial tool for forecasting the potential impacts of climate change and development on watershed dynamics. While some elements of this work may require a longer-term approach, its inclusion in the 2025 budget planning process is an essential step toward enhancing watershed resiliency and sustainability. This initiative will ensure that CH continues to build on its existing expertise while addressing critical knowledge gaps to support informed decision-making and effective watershed management. Conservation Halton, in collaboration with the ORMGP, has created a hydrologic water balance model for the area within CH's jurisdiction, referred to hereafter as the "study area."
